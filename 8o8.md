# 8o8

- Refactored `getSlideFile` to detect standard `/<bucket>/<object>` paths and Replit-specific `/.private/` paths.
- Supports both Replit object storage and Google Cloud Storage style paths.
- Updated presentation viewer to prefix `/slide-images` for non-HTTP image URLs, ensuring Replit paths continue to work without a special check.
