## Self-Contained Tools

This repository includes optional tools that run separately from the main application.

- **Card Builder**: `npm run card-builder` starts a local drag-and-drop card editor at http://localhost:3100.
- **Code Explorer**: `npm run code-explorer <target-directory>` indexes a directory and serves a visual explorer at http://localhost:3200.

These tools are standalone and do not affect production or the main development server.
