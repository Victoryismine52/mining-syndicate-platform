# Mining Syndicate Platform

## Development

- **Full application**: `npm run dev`
  - Starts the Express API and Vite client.
  - Visit `http://localhost:5000` to view the site.
- **Isolated Code Explorer**: `npm run dev:explorer`
  - Launches only the Code Explorer module at `http://localhost:5000/explorer`.
  - Uses the same React, Tailwind and UI components as the main app.
  - Requires `git` and network access to import public repositories.

No additional environment variables are required; the server listens on `PORT` if set (defaults to `5000`).

## Self-Contained Tools

This repository includes optional tools that run separately from the main application.

- **Card Builder**: `npm run card-builder` starts a local drag-and-drop card editor at `http://localhost:3100`. See [Card Builder â€“ Use Case and Requirements](docs/card-builder-use-case-requirements.md) for details on the MVP.

- **Code Explorer**: `npm run dev:explorer` as noted above. A mock repository based on the local code-explorer package is served for testing.

These tools are standalone and do not affect production or the main development server.
