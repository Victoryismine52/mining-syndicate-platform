# Documentation Style Guide

Consistency keeps our guides accessible and easy to maintain. Follow these conventions when writing.

## Tone
- Write in the second person ("you") and stay in active voice.
- Keep sentences short and confident.
- Sound helpful without being formal; skip exclamation marks.

## Formatting
- Start each page with an H1 title.
- Use sentence case for headings.
- Use ordered lists for sequences and bullet lists for options.
- Wrap commands and code samples in fenced blocks.
- Mention file formats in uppercase (`JSON`, `OpenAPI`).
- Use relative links to other docs.

## Cross-links
- Connect related topics. For export steps and JSON/OpenAPI downloads, see [Exporting Cards](./exporting-cards.md).
