# Documentation Style Guide

Consistency keeps our guides accessible and easy to maintain. Follow these conventions when writing.

## Tone
- Address the reader as "you" and use active voice.
- Prefer short sentences and everyday language.

## Formatting
- Start each page with an H1 title.
- Use sentence case for headings.
- Wrap commands and code samples in fenced blocks.
- Mention file formats in uppercase (`JSON`, `OpenAPI`).

## Cross-links
- Connect related topics. For export steps and JSON/OpenAPI downloads, see [Exporting Cards](./exporting-cards.md).
