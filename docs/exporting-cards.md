# Exporting Cards

Turn a Card Builder creation into a reusable module that ships with its own API contract.

## Before you start
- Start the Card Builder locally:
  ```bash
  npm run card-builder
  ```
- Design your card on the canvas.

## Export
1. Click **Export** in the toolbar.
2. Choose a component format: React or Web Component.
3. Pick your downloads:
   - **card.json** captures the card configuration.
   - **openapi.yaml** lists the generated endpoints.
4. Save the files to your project.

## Next steps
- Import the component into your application.
- Wire the documented endpoints to your backend.
