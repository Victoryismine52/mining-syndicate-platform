# Toolbar Naming, Export, and Gallery Delete Wireframes

These sketches map the latest flow for naming cards, exporting them, and managing deletions in the gallery.

## Toolbar: name field & export button
```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| [card name____________________]                [ Export ]        |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
- Name field auto-trims spaces and defaults to **Untitled Card**.
- Export button opens a modal confirming assets and API bundle.

## Gallery: delete affordance
```
+------------------------------+
| [thumbnail]  Card Title      |
|              [ðŸ—‘ Delete]     |
+------------------------------+
```
- Trash icon reveals a confirm dialog before removal.
- Successful deletion animates the card fading out.
