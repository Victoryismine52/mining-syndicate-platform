# Toolbar Naming, Export, and Gallery Delete Wireframes

These sketches map the flow for naming cards, exporting them, and deleting saved cards in the gallery.

## Toolbar: Name field & Export button
```
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Name: [ Untitled Card________ ]                        [ Export ]  |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
- Name field auto-trims spaces and falls back to **Untitled Card**.
- Export button opens a modal confirming assets and API bundle.
- Export button is disabled until a non-empty name is provided.

## Gallery: delete affordance
```
+----------------------------------------------+
| [thumbnail]  Card Title                [ðŸ—‘]   |
+----------------------------------------------+
```
- Trash icon appears on hover; clicking prompts a confirm dialog before removal.
- Successful deletion fades the card out and cleans up localStorage.
