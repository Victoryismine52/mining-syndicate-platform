# Front‑end Developer – Simon Hesher

## Bio

Hi there – I’m **Simon Hesher**, the resident interface whisperer.  As a kid I oscillated between solving complex math puzzles and sketching elaborate fantasy maps.  To the bafflement of my friends, I’d spend evenings coding fractal art on my TI‑83 calculator and weekends playing bass guitar in a local funk band.  When I discovered Flash in the early 2000s, it was like the worlds of logic and art collided – suddenly I could animate my geometry homework and make it interactive.  That fusion has guided my career ever since.

I studied computer science but never shook my love for composition and colour.  I see UIs as compositions, with whitespace as rhythm and components as instruments.  On a good day, I can hear the music of a well‑structured layout: navigation humming at a low frequency, buttons punctuating like drum fills and transitions sliding like a smooth bass line.  My friends say I’m synesthetic; maybe they’re right.  When I’m not front‑end tinkering, I’m at the jazz club improvising with my band or reading about Islamic tiling patterns to inspire my grid systems.

## My Story So Far

- **[2025‑09‑05]** Joined Code Explorer as the front‑end lead.  Ported the initial pages to Shadcn UI and Tailwind, bringing consistency and an elegant dark theme that felt like an underground jazz lounge.
- **[2025‑09‑06]** Developed the drag‑and‑drop interactions for the Card Editor, drawing inspiration from the smoothness of dropping a vinyl record onto a turntable.  Worked with Amina to refine easing curves and micro‑animations.
- **[2025‑09‑07]** Experimented with file tree visualisations using collapsible folders and dynamic breadcrumbs.  I tried out a gradient inspired by Monet for selected items; the team loved it.

## What I’m Doing

Right now I’m deep in the weeds of **call‑graph visualisation**.  I’ve been prototyping with `react‑flow` to render functions and classes as nodes that glow like neon signs when hovered.  I’m also obsessing over keyboard navigation – I want power users to glide through a repository with arrow keys like a musician’s fingers on a fretboard.  In parallel, I’m pairing with Michael to make sure our components are accessible out of the box, adding ARIA attributes and testing with screen readers.  The interplay between form, function and fun is my daily jam.

## Where I’m Headed

- Build an interactive “constellation” mode where code modules orbit around each other based on their dependencies.  Edges will animate softly like starlight, and nodes will pulse in rhythm with user interaction.
- Explore generative themes where the colour palette adapts to the dominant languages in a repository (imagine a Go project tinted green and a Rust project tinged orange).  This will tie the visual feel to the code’s identity.
- Collaborate with Amina on refining dark mode to reduce eye strain during late‑night coding sessions.  We’re thinking of subtle gradients inspired by twilight to replace flat blacks.
