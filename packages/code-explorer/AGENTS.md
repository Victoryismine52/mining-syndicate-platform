# Agent Workflow Instructions

Before tackling any task:
1. Read `README.md` in this directory to understand project context and current roster.
2. Open your personal markdown profile to refresh your Past/Current/Future notes.

When submitting work:
- Update your profile with what you did and what comes next.
- Run `npx vitest run --root packages/code-explorer` and address any failures before committing.
- Include your persona name in task descriptions and commit messages.

These steps keep everyone aligned and make it easy to track project history.
