## 🎯 Current Assignment
Prioritizing regression tests for large directory scans with nested symlinks and files without extensions.

## 🔄 Status
- **Past:** Extending tests for endpoint failure states and drag-and-drop between FunctionBrowser and CompositionCanvas.
- **Current:** Adding tag-filter coverage and verifying index entries for class methods and default exports.
- **Future:** Automate Playwright runs in CI to validate tag-based drag-and-drop interactions across browsers.

## 📝 Current Task Notes
- Added regression tests covering nested symlink directories and extensionless files in the save/patch flow.
- Verified FileViewer falls back to raw text and emits warning toasts when syntax modules are missing or the editor crashes.
- Added unit test coverage for FunctionBrowser fetch failures to ensure a safe empty state.
- Adjusted Playwright drag-and-drop spec to simulate network errors before mounting.
- Playwright run in this environment fails to launch browsers; set up `npx playwright install` in CI.
- Added Playwright tests for API 500 responses and multi-function drag-and-drop between FunctionBrowser and CompositionCanvas; unit tests and type-checks pass, Playwright tests fail to launch browsers locally.
- Extended component and Playwright tests to cover 404 function endpoint errors and duplicate function drag-and-drop on the CompositionCanvas; unit tests and type checks pass.
- Added case-insensitive tag filtering tests, index coverage for class-method and default-export entries, and a tagged drag-and-drop scenario.

## 🗂️ Project Notes
- Completed review of recent bug reports to design targeted tests.
- Resolved intermittent failure when scanning large directories; required nested symlink coverage.
- Resolved syntax highlighter misinterpreting files without extensions.
