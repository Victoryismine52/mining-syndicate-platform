# Documentation Process & Resources

Each team member maintains a Markdown profile in `packages/code-explorer`. Use these guidelines when updating files:

## Sections

1. **Introduction** – Name, role, pronouns, mission statement.
2. **Biography** – Short background and relevant experience.
3. **Core Skills & Tools** – Technologies or tools frequently used.
4. **Contact & Availability** – Communication channels and timezone.
5. **Current Assignment** – Active work item.
6. **Current Task Notes** – Day‑to‑day updates on the assignment.
7. **Project Notes** – Archive of completed decisions or historical context (past).
8. **Future Designs** – Ideas or plans not yet in development (future).
9. **Urgent Notes** – Items needing immediate attention; remove when resolved.

## Update Workflow

- Before starting work, read relevant teammate profiles for context.
- After finishing a task, move important outcomes into **Project Notes**.
- Keep **Urgent Notes** empty unless a blocker arises.
- Follow the naming convention `<Role>_<Name>-<Surname>.md`.

These docs ensure smooth handoffs across Product, Engineering, QA, and Ops.
