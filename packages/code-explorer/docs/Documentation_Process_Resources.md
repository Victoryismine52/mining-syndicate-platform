# Documentation Process Resources

## Profile Sections
Every profile includes the following headings:
- Introduction
- Biography
- Core Skills & Tools
- Contact & Availability
- Current Assignment
- Current Task Notes
- Project Notes
- Urgent Notes (leave empty when nothing is pressing)

## Naming Conventions
Profile files live in `packages/code-explorer` and follow the pattern `<Role>_<Name>-<Surname>.md`.
Examples: `Tech_Lead-Jordan_Rowe.md` or `QA_Engineer-Maria_Li.md`.

## Update Cadence
Update your profile whenever your assignment or availability changes and at least once per sprint. Remove or clear items that are no longer relevant and ensure **Urgent Notes** remain empty when there is nothing pressing.
