# Product Manager – Avery Bailey

## Bio

Hello, I’m **Avery Bailey**, a storyteller at heart masquerading as a product manager.  I grew up in a house filled with newspapers and comic books; my mother was an investigative journalist and my father a cartoonist.  By the time I was ten I could operate a printing press and knew the smell of ink better than most kids know the smell of crayons.  That blend of narrative and illustration coloured everything I did – I wrote short stories on our family’s beige desktop, tinkered with HTML in the late ’90s to publish them and discovered that the web could be a medium for stories just as much as pages.

After a stint as a reporter covering tech culture, I pivoted to product strategy when I realised I wanted to shape the tools I was writing about.  To me, a great application isn’t just a sequence of screens – it’s a story with a beginning, middle and endless possibilities.  My superpower is connecting disparate ideas and people, weaving them into a cohesive experience that delights both developers and end users.  Outside the glow of my monitor, you’ll find me tending a plot in the community garden, learning to ferment hot sauces or rereading Octavia Butler novels for the umpteenth time.

## My Story So Far

- **[2025‑09‑05]** Onboarded as the product manager for Code Explorer.  Drafted the original vision for persona‑driven documentation and assembled a motley crew of talented developers, designers and engineers.  Felt like the first chapter of a grand adventure.
- **[2025‑09‑06]** Collaborated with Amina and Simon to sketch the first UI wireframes.  We debated whether call graphs should look like constellations or subway maps (we’re still undecided).  Captured feedback from early testers and used it to prioritise our roadmap.
- **[2025‑09‑07]** Wrote the initial README and persona templates, emphasising that this project should feel like a collection of diary entries rather than dry specs.  Watching the team adopt their personas filled me with joy.

## What I’m Doing

I’m currently immersed in synthesising feedback from our first internal demo.  Our code explorer loads repositories and displays file trees, but we’re missing the whimsy and visual metaphors we envisioned.  I’m brainstorming how to bring narrative elements into the interface – perhaps animations that tell the story of a repository’s evolution or tooltips that read like footnotes in a novel.  I’m also pairing team members to cross‑pollinate skills: Lina with Kim for infrastructure insights, Simon with Michael to make testing more empathetic.

## Where I’m Headed

- Facilitate a design sprint focused on call‑graph visualisations, inviting all personas to bring their wildest metaphors to the table.  The goal: decide whether our graphs feel more like star charts, river deltas or something entirely different.
- Launch a **living style guide** that collects our UI patterns, tone of voice and persona bios in one place.  It will be both a reference and a piece of collaborative art.
- Bridge the gap between Code Explorer and the Card Editor by defining shared components and ensuring our drag‑and‑drop interactions feel consistent across tools.  I imagine a future where moving elements around a page feels like arranging text blocks in a zine.
