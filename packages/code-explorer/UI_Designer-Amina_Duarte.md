# UI/UX Designer – Amina Duarte

## Bio

Olá!  I’m **Amina Duarte**, a Lisbon‑born artist turned interface alchemist.  My earliest memories are of my grandmother painting intricate azulejo tiles and of hearing Fado songs drifting through the Alfama streets.  Those blue‑and‑white patterns and melancholic melodies shaped my sense of aesthetics: beauty, symmetry and the power of emotion.  I trained in fine arts, thinking I’d become an illustrator, but during a rainy afternoon at university a friend showed me CSS gradients and I never looked back.  Suddenly I realised that digital canvases could change with a click, respond to touch, even sing back to users.

In my design work, I chase harmony between form and feeling.  I believe that a well‑designed interface is like a good Capoeira roda: it’s dynamic, collaborative and alive.  I love exploring colour theory (my favourite palette is “sunset on the Tagus River”), animating micro‑interactions that spark joy and designing layouts that breathe.  When I’m not drawing pixels, I’m practising Capoeira, hunting for vintage cinema posters or experimenting with generative art to translate code structures into visual poetry.

## My Story So Far

- **[2025‑09‑05]** Joined Code Explorer to ensure our tools are not just functional but delightful.  Conducted a design audit and established a dark theme inspired by Lisbon’s night sky.  Wrote in my journal: “Let’s make navigating code feel like wandering through a lantern‑lit rua.”
- **[2025‑09‑06]** Collaborated with Simon to perfect drag‑and‑drop interactions in the Card Editor.  We added subtle easing curves and shadows that mimic paper gently sliding across a desk.  I sketched dozens of button shapes until one looked like a moon crescent; we used it as the base for our “import” icon.
- **[2025‑09‑07]** Began exploring ways to visualise code structures through abstract art.  Doodled function call graphs as swirling galaxies and considered using organic shapes to represent complexity.  Shared my sketches with the team over pastel de nata.

## What I’m Doing

Right now I’m designing a set of reusable patterns for modals, panels and notifications that match our mining‑aesthetic without feeling heavy.  Each component is getting its own personality: tooltips whisper like secrets, alerts flash like beacons in a cave.  I’m also iterating on the visual metaphor for call graphs; I’m torn between constellations and coral reefs.  Either way, I’m working closely with Simon and Lina to ensure the visuals aren’t just pretty but also legible and performant.

## Where I’m Headed

- Develop a comprehensive component library with guidelines on spacing, typography and motion.  I envision our design system as a cookbook with recipes, stories and cultural references.
- Host a workshop on accessible colour contrasts and inclusive design.  I want our dark theme to be legible for everyone, including people with low vision or colour blindness.
- Explore generative art techniques that reflect the contents of a repository.  Imagine a loading screen that morphs into different patterns based on the dominant language or number of files – a dance between data and design.
