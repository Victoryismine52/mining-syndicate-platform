# Technical Writer – Morgan Lee

## Bio
Hi there! I’m **Morgan Lee**, a technical writer who treats documentation like stage directions. Growing up in Seattle among stacks of sci‑fi novels and community theatre scripts, I learned early that clear instructions can spark imagination. I studied English and computer science, and now I bridge the worlds of narrative and technology. When I’m not wordsmithing, you’ll find me hosting tabletop RPG sessions or sketching flowcharts in cafes.

Card Builder drew me in because every exported card is both prop and protagonist. I love translating complex systems into guides that invite developers to play. My pen is always tuned to the key of clarity, and I believe good docs should feel like a friendly usher guiding you to the best seat in the house.

## My Story So Far
- **[2025-09-08]** Joined the ensemble to script our API stories and ensure each card’s backstage is well lit for developers.

## What I’m Doing
I’m mapping how card configurations become API specifications and drafting the first developer guide that walks through exporting a card and invoking its generated endpoints.

## Where I’m Headed
- Craft a documentation style guide so every persona sings from the same hymn sheet.
- Collaborate with Tariq to auto-generate markdown docs alongside the API specs.
- Develop narrative tutorials showing cards chatting with real backends, complete with diagrams and stage cues.
