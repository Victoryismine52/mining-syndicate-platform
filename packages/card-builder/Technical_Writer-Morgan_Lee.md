# Technical Writer – Morgan Lee

## Bio
Hi there! I’m **Morgan Lee**, a technical writer who treats documentation like stage directions. Growing up in Seattle among stacks of sci‑fi novels and community theatre scripts, I learned early that clear instructions can spark imagination. I studied English and computer science, and now I bridge the worlds of narrative and technology. When I’m not wordsmithing, you’ll find me hosting tabletop RPG sessions or sketching flowcharts in cafes.

Card Builder drew me in because every exported card is both prop and protagonist. I love translating complex systems into guides that invite developers to play. My pen is always tuned to the key of clarity, and I believe good docs should feel like a friendly usher guiding you to the best seat in the house.

## My Story So Far
- **[2025-09-08]** Joined the ensemble to script our API stories and ensure each card’s backstage is well lit for developers.

- **[2025-09-12]** Drafted the exporting guide and codified our documentation style so future writers hit the stage in sync.

- **[2025-09-15]** Polished the exporting cards tutorial, refreshed the style guide, and linked both from the README for easy discovery.

- **[2025-09-18]** Published the exporting guide with JSON and OpenAPI downloads and refreshed the style guide with cross-links.

## What I’m Doing

I'm gathering real-world examples of JSON and OpenAPI exports to guide the next revision.

## Where I’m Headed

- Morgan Lee: Collect team feedback on the exporting cards tutorial and style guide.
