# Card Builder AGENT Instructions

## Orientation

1. Always begin by reading `AGENT.md` to ensure you have the latest guidance.
2. Read `README.md` in this directory to understand project goals, personas, and roster.
3. Review each persona markdown file (`*_*.md`) to learn backgrounds and responsibilities before assigning work.

## Task Planning

- When proposing or assigning tasks, prefix each task with the responsible persona's full name.
- Include a starter task stub: `- [ ] Read AGENT.md` so future agents begin with the current process.

## Persona Updates

- If your work affects a persona, append a dated note to the relevant persona file describing the change.
