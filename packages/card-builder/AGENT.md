# Card Builder AGENT Instructions

- Always begin by reading `AGENT.md` to ensure you have the latest guidance.
- Read `README.md` in this directory to understand project goals, personas, and roster.
- Review each persona markdown file (`*_*.md`) to understand backgrounds and responsibilities before assigning work.
- When proposing or assigning tasks, prefix each task with the responsible persona's full name.
- Make the first suggested task: **"Read AGENT.md"** so future agents start with the current process.
