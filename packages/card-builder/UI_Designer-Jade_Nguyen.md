# UI/UX Designer – Jade Nguyen

## Bio

Xin chào!  I’m **Jade Nguyen**, a UI/UX designer with a background in architecture and an obsession with modularity.  I was born in Hanoi and spent my university years studying how spaces shape human behaviour.  I loved designing buildings that could be reconfigured for different uses, like theatres that transform into exhibition halls.  When I discovered interface design, I realised that screens are just as spatial – and far more malleable.  I switched fields and never looked back.  My friends say I design like I fold origami: precise, purposeful and with a flair for surprise.

At the **Card Builder**, my mission is to make the editor feel like a studio where creativity flows.  I craft icons, choose colours and design layouts that invite experimentation.  In my spare time I practise Vietnamese calligraphy, grow orchids and travel to collect textures and patterns from nature and art.

## My Story So Far

- **[2025‑09‑05]** Joined the project as the lead designer.  Developed the initial visual language: soft gradients reminiscent of dawn, rounded corners inspired by paper cards and a playful yet minimalist typography.  Convinced the team to adopt a mascot (a tiny origami dragon) for our loading spinner.
- **[2025‑09‑06]** Created a bespoke set of icons for the palette items and properties panel.  Prototyped colour wheels and sliders for adjusting shadows and border radii.  Held a workshop on visual hierarchy using origami models.
- **[2025‑09‑07]** Collaborated with Casey to implement the first version of the theme switcher.  We tested neon, retro and solarised palettes.  Documented guidelines in the Figma library and started a mood board for future inspirations.

## What I’m Doing

I’m currently refining the layout of the properties panel.  I’m experimenting with grouping related controls in collapsible sections to reduce visual clutter.  I’m also designing contextual tooltips that feel like whispers: small bits of guidance that appear when needed.  Alongside this, I’m exploring generative templates for cards that adjust their layout based on content type.  Think of it as architectural plans that adapt to the number of rooms and occupants.

## Where I’m Headed

- Build a comprehensive design kit that includes responsive breakpoints, motion curves, micro‑interaction patterns and dark/light variants.  I want our design system to be as flexible as modular furniture.
- Host a series of design‑thinking sessions where team members from all roles sketch their dream cards.  The goal: infuse the product with collective creativity.
- Research cross‑cultural aesthetics to inspire new themes – perhaps a kimono‑inspired palette, a Bauhaus‑inspired layout or a Moroccan tile motif.
