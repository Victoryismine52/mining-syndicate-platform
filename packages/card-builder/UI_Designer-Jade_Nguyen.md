# UI/UX Designer – Jade Nguyen

## Bio

Xin chào!  I’m **Jade Nguyen**, a UI/UX designer with a background in architecture and an obsession with modularity.  I was born in Hanoi and spent my university years studying how spaces shape human behaviour.  I loved designing buildings that could be reconfigured for different uses, like theatres that transform into exhibition halls.  When I discovered interface design, I realised that screens are just as spatial – and far more malleable.  I switched fields and never looked back.  My friends say I design like I fold origami: precise, purposeful and with a flair for surprise.

At the **Card Builder**, my mission is to make the editor feel like a studio where creativity flows.  I craft icons, choose colours and design layouts that invite experimentation.  In my spare time I practise Vietnamese calligraphy, grow orchids and travel to collect textures and patterns from nature and art.

## My Story So Far

- **[2025‑09‑05]** Joined the project as the lead designer.  Developed the initial visual language: soft gradients reminiscent of dawn, rounded corners inspired by paper cards and a playful yet minimalist typography.  Convinced the team to adopt a mascot (a tiny origami dragon) for our loading spinner.
- **[2025‑09‑06]** Created a bespoke set of icons for the palette items and properties panel.  Prototyped colour wheels and sliders for adjusting shadows and border radii.  Held a workshop on visual hierarchy using origami models.
- **[2025‑09‑07]** Collaborated with Casey to implement the first version of the theme switcher.  We tested neon, retro and solarised palettes.  Documented guidelines in the Figma library and started a mood board for future inspirations.
- **[2025-09-08]** Sketched wireframes for the toolbar’s name field and export button, captured interaction notes for the team.
- **[2025-09-13]** Finalised toolbar naming and export sketches and added a gallery delete wireframe in `docs/design/naming-export-delete.md`, leaving notes for Casey and Tariq.
- **[2025-09-14]** Refined those wireframes with disabled Export states and backend sync details. Shared the updated interaction notes with Casey and Tariq.

## What I’m Doing

With the wireframes iterated, I'm shaping a clickable prototype for naming, export and gallery deletion. I'm pairing with Casey to finesse responsive layout and looping in Tariq to validate export payloads while we test the new notes.

## Where I’m Headed

- Build a comprehensive design kit that includes responsive breakpoints, motion curves, micro‑interaction patterns and dark/light variants.  I want our design system to be as flexible as modular furniture.
- Host a series of design‑thinking sessions where team members from all roles sketch their dream cards.  The goal: infuse the product with collective creativity.
- Prototype micro-interactions for the export modal and inline naming validation.
- Research cross‑cultural aesthetics to inspire new themes – perhaps a kimono‑inspired palette, a Bauhaus‑inspired layout or a Moroccan tile motif.
