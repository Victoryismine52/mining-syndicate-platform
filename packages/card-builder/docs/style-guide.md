# Documentation Style Guide

## Tone
- Write in a friendly, conversational voice.
- Prefer active verbs and clear stage directions.
- Keep paragraphs short and inviting.

## Naming Conventions
- Refer to the product as **Card Builder**.
- Use `camelCase` for function names and `PascalCase` for components.
- File names are `kebab-case.md`.

## Headings
- Use sentence case for all headings.
- Keep sections short; if a heading has only one sentence, consider folding it into the parent section.

## Links
- Use descriptive text like `[Exporting Cards](exporting-cards.md)` instead of bare URLs.
- Prefer relative paths when linking to other docs in this package.

## Code Blocks
- Annotate code fences with the language: ```` ```ts```` or ```` ```json````.
- Keep examples focused and no wider than 80 characters.
- Show input and output when it aids understanding.
