# Documentation Style Guide

## Tone
- Write in a friendly, conversational voice.
- Prefer active verbs and clear stage directions.
- Keep paragraphs short and inviting.

## Naming Conventions
- Refer to the product as **Card Builder**.
- Use `camelCase` for function names and `PascalCase` for components.
- File names are `kebab-case.md`.

## Code Blocks
- Annotate code fences with the language: ```` ```ts```` or ```` ```json````.
- Keep examples focused and no wider than 80 characters.
- Show input and output when it aids understanding.

> Sync with engineering personas—Backend Developer Tariq Al-Fulani and Frontend Developer Casey Rivera—before publishing major changes to ensure docs match the implementation.
