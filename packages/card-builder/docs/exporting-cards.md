# Exporting Cards

The Card Builder lets you export a designed card along with its API description. Use the **Export** button in the toolbar to download:

- **Card JSON** – a snapshot of the card's layout and settings.
- **OpenAPI spec** – a machine‑readable description of the endpoints generated for the card.

Choose your desired format from the export dropdown. The browser will download the selected files, which you can integrate into your application or share with others.

> _Implementation details are verified with Backend Developer Tariq Al‑Fulani and Frontend Developer Casey Rivera so the export flow remains consistent with the codebase._
