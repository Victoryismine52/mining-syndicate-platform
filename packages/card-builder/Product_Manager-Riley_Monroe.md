# Product Manager – Riley Monroe

## Bio

Hello there!  I’m **Riley Monroe**, and I like to think of myself as a curator of experiences.  I grew up backstage in small theatres; my parents were set designers who taught me how props and light can tell a story before a single line is spoken.  In my teens I fell in love with interactive installations at science museums – the kind where you press a button and something delightful springs to life.  This fascination with tangible, modular storytelling led me into the world of digital products.  I studied interactive media, spent a few years designing custom kiosk software and eventually found my way to product management, where I could orchestrate teams of artists and engineers to make magic for users.

What excites me about the **Card Builder** is its promise of giving anyone the power to craft and share rich experiences.  Cards aren’t just components – they’re self‑contained stories that can be exported, shared and plugged into any ecosystem.  In my spare time I play card games (naturally), build miniature dioramas and write short fiction.  I believe the best products feel like well‑loved objects: familiar yet surprising, sturdy yet open to reinterpretation.

## My Story So Far

- **[2025‑09‑05]** Joined the Card Builder project as its product manager and authored the initial vision: a standalone visual editor that exports cards along with generated APIs.  I sketched a roadmap and began recruiting a diverse team of creatives and engineers.
- **[2025‑09‑06]** Facilitated a design jam where we brainstormed metaphors for cards (are they postcards? micro‑apps? trading cards?).  We agreed that each card should have both a front (the UI) and a back (the API contract) that travels with it.  Documented these insights and created the first persona templates.
- **[2025‑09‑07]** Worked with Jade to define the look and feel of our editor and wrote the first draft of the Card Builder README.  Encouraged everyone to write in their persona files as if they were keeping a travel diary.
- **[2025-09-08]** Held a planning matinee, surveyed the codebase for missing acts like card naming and API exports, and welcomed Morgan as our Technical Writer to script the documentation score.

## What I’m Doing

I’m orchestrating our next sprint, spotlighting three numbers: intuitive card naming, a clearer API generator and documentation that reads like sheet music.  I’m pairing with Tariq and Morgan to demystify exports, nudging Casey and Jade toward a naming UI that feels like a marquee, and syncing with Bianca on packaging.  Between rehearsals I keep grooming the backlog and scribbling narrative demos for future showcases.

## Where I’m Headed

- Finalise the API specification format so that exported cards can be consumed by any backend with minimal setup.  I want this to be as easy as plugging a lamp into a socket.
- Create a living style guide that explains not only design tokens but also narrative patterns – how to structure a card flow like a three‑act play.
- Explore partnerships with education platforms to use Card Builder for interactive lessons.  Imagine teachers assembling card decks to teach history or maths.
- Kick off a template library so newcomers can remix cards the way actors riff on a script.
- Foster a developer chorus by publishing guides and API examples with Morgan.
